After doing the exercise I do feel confident to use the methods but at the same time I also feel that I need to repeatedly doing this so I do not forget.
I would like to do more practice runs on the other array functions that were in the Ruby Documentation.
I don't have any questions regarding the array functions I think they are pretty much straightforward, I just need to practice more.
